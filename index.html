                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>The project was provided by the Dutch Ministry of Defense, specifically by the
                      13 Lichte Brigade. This branch of the Ministry of Defense specializes in the
                      application of combat or peace operations in case of disasters and calamities
                      worldwide.
                      13 Lichte Brigade has given us the assignment to create a solution for military
                      drone operators to practice their skills in case of full airspaces, allowing them
                      to keep their skills up to standards at all times.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to create a viable solution for Military drone operators to practice
                      their flying skills in case of full airspaces, we as QuantumMonkey Studios have
                      been developing a virtual drone simulator. This simulator allows pilots to
                      maneuver a drone through a virtual environment, focusing on the feeling of
                      realism when it comes to maneuvering the virtual drone.
                      The second focus of this simulator is also what sets this simulator apart from
                      competitors. And that is the tactical deployment of the virtual drone within the
                      simulator. Focusing on representing real life tactical missions, in which drones
                      are deployed
                    </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>This project was developed by four students, including myself, during my third semester at Fontys
                      University of Applied Sciences as part of an open learning semester. The game was created for the
                      Practoraat Interactieve Technologie at ROC Tilburg with the aim of teaching Dutch to immigrant
                      students at Schakelcollege. These students work on different topics each period, and we selected
                      the home environment topic, which fit perfectly with their curriculum.<br />
                      The game was also featured in a post and article.<br />

                      vibrant and full of life, is now ravaged by death, decay, and destruction. It is Shizen's mission
                      to restore the world he once cherished.</p>

                      where I studied Application & Media Design. For this assignment, we chose to create a 2D
                      platformer. The game originally included a homemade controller as well. We had approximately six
                      weeks to complete the project.</p>

                    <p>During the first six weeks of my internship at Enversed Studios, I had to create a VR

                      workflow. The game included all the basic functionalities available in the Enversed Framework. All
                      other aspects, such as game design and user testing, were taken just as seriously as if it were a
                      project for a client.</p>

                    <p>Enversed Studios noticed that many of their clients had a large number of inexperienced users. A
                      lot of these users struggled to understand VR and found it too complicated to learn. My task was
                      to research the reasons behind this: what made VR so difficult and why these users gave up. Based
                      on my findings, I then had to create a prototype to help improve Enversed Studios' tutorials.</p>

        Hi, my name is Ben. I was born on November 12, 1999, in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
        <br />
        I am passionate about games, music, movies, Japanese language & culture, and the idea of achieving one's dreams.
        I firmly believe that anyone can reach their goals as long as they put in the time and effort!
        <br />
        <br />
        One of my biggest passions right now is Japan. The country has had a huge influence on me, thanks to my family,
        who have always been fans of Japanese culture. They introduced me to Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Pokémon at a
        young age. Interestingly, I watched Ultraman and Kamen Rider in Thai because my mom is from Thailand.
        <br />
        Visiting Japan in 2013 and 2016 changed everything for me. I fell in love not only with Japanese media but also
        with the country and its culture. Since then, I've made it my goal to move to Japan in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2017, I briefly studied Oriental Languages and Communication (Japanese) at Zuyd University of Applied
        Sciences. However, I left after 3-4 months because the subjects didn't pique my interest. Still, my passion for
        the Japanese language and culture never faded. I kept studying Japanese on my own and eventually realized that
        textbooks weren't my thing. Instead, I adopted a more practical and consistent approach to learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the last 10 years, I've had multiple side jobs in different industries. I've worked as a stock clerk,
        newspaper deliverer, food deliverer, and even as a voluntary animal caretaker.
        Beyond work, I've been involved in personal creative projects. I play guitar, bass, and drums, and I enjoy
        singing (even if I'm not that good). I also produce music and used to be my brother's cameraman for his guitar
        cover videos. On top of that, I have some experience with video editing.
        editing.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2018, I started studying Application & Media Development at ROC Ter AA in Helmond, The Netherlands. There, I
        learned several coding languages, mainly focusing on web, software, and hardware (Arduino) development. During
        my studies, I completed two internships: IBT Software Developer at DAF Trucks N.V. and Software Developer at Smartgoals / Spinnov.

        My graduation assignment was graded Outstanding (10/10), with most subjects receiving a score above 8 (except
        Dutch).
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I'm studying HBO-ICT at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, specializing in Game Development and
        Design. I've worked on multiple impactful projects, including: <b>Learn Language in VR</b>, which was a
        well-received project that was referenced in later semesters, and
        <b>Project HoneyBee</b>, which was a military drone simulator that won the <b>SPARC Award for Most Innovative Solution.</b>
        <br/>
        During my studies, I also completed an internship at Enversed Studios, a VR game development company. Initially,
        some coaches doubted whether I would be accepted, but I was determined to prove myself. In the end, I secured
        the
        internship and gained valuable experience working in the VR industry. This experience reinforced my belief that
        perseverance and dedication can open doors, even when others have doubts.
        <br />
        <br />
        During my sixth semester at Fontys, I achieved part of my dream by being selected for an exchange program at
        Chuo
        University in Tokyo, Japan. I took courses in literature, trying a different academic direction. Those five
        months
        were among the best of my life and strengthened my determination to move to Japan. It also reinforced my belief
        that with enough effort, I can achieve anything.
        <br />
        Currently, I'm in my graduation semester, working on a project for my internship company while applying to
        master's programs in Japan. Moving back to Japan to earn my master's degree is my main goal right now.
        <br />

              <p>
              <h5>Self-Critical</h5>
              Ben always has the feeling that he can do more and better. It's very hard to satisfy himself.
              This can also be a positive side, because sometimes this creates a feeling of guilt to work
              harder.<br><br>

              <h5>Awkward</h5>
              Ben is very awkward when starting out somewhere. He will need some time to get comfortable.
              But when he's eventually comfortable, he's a very supportive teammate.<br><br>

              <h5>Direct</h5>
              When Ben is comfortable, he can get very direct with his opinion. This is not meant to offend the other
              party, it's usually constructive criticism.
              But people might see it as a personal attack.<br><br>
