        <p class="text-white">
          Hi, my name is Ben. I was born on the 12th of November 1999 in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
          <br>
          I am very passionate about games, music, movies, Japanese language & culture and being able to achieve your dreams. 
          And I think that everybody can achieve their dreams as long as they put the time and effort into it!
          <br>
          <br>
          So, let's dive a bit deeper into my passions. The most important passions right now are games and Japanese. Let's start with gaming. Ever since I was a child, I played a lot of games.
          At a very young age I got a limited edition Pokémon Yellow GameBoy Color gifted, and I fell in love immediately. 
          And currently I'm studying at Fontys with the main focus of creating games.
          <br>
          <br>
          Japan has also had a huge influence on me. My family has always been a huge fan of Japan and they kind of pulled me into it. I grew up watching Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Pokémon.
          Although I did watch Ultraman and Kamen Rider in Thai because my mom is from Thailand.
          <br>
          Back in 2013 and 2016 I went to Japan on a vacation. And that completely changed everything. Not only did I love Japanese media, but the country and culture as well. 
          And I have made it one of my main goals to move to Japan in the future!
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2017 I started studying Oriental Languages and Communication (Japanese) at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences. Sadly, I did quit after 3-4 months due to uninteresting subjects.
          But my love for the Japanese language and culture never went away! I kept studying Japanese every now and then. And noticed that textbooks aren't my thing. 
          So, I'm taking a completely different approach to learning the language and I have been doing it more consistently!
          <br>
          <br>
          In the last 10 years, I have also had multiple side jobs in different sectors. I have worked as a stock clerk, newspaper deliverer, food deliverer and animal caretaker (voluntary work).
          Next to side jobs, I have also been very busy with individual projects such as making music, I play guitar, bass, drums, like to sing (although not that good) and produce music.
          I also used to be my brother's cameraman for his guitar covers. And lastly I have some experience with video editting.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2018 I started studying Application & Media Development at ROC Ter AA in Helmond, The Netherlands. 
          Here I learned many coding languages mainly around Web, Software and Hardware (Arduino) development.
          While studying I had 2 interships one as a ICT (Industrial Control Techniques) Software Developer at DAF TRUCKS N.V. and Software Developer at Smartgoals / Spinnov.
          My graduation assignment was graded with an Outstanding (10/10) and every subject was graded above an 8 (except Dutch).
          <br>
          <br>
          For the upcoming next years, I plan to continue working on my game development & design, to be able to get a job in the very competitive game development market.
          Currently we are making a VR Game to learn Dutch and I'm also following an Unreal Engine 5 (C++) course.
          Simply put, I want to learn and improve C#, C++, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          To see more of my programming skills, look at my resume and projects!

                </h1>
                <p>
                  <h5>Reliable</h5>
                  Ben is a reliable person because he feels the responsibility of his work. He will try his best not to let people down!<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Passionate And Ambitious</h5>
                  Ben is a very passionate and ambitious person. He will not give up on the things he wants. Ben has many ambitions and will work extra hard to achieve these.<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Curious</h5>
                  Ben is very curious and is always willing to learn new skills.<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Inspiring</h5>
                  Ben knows the importance of ambitions and will always tell family, friends and teammates to follow and work hard to achieve their own goals in life.<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Empathetic</h5>
                  If someone Ben knows struggles with something, he is always open to talk about their problems. This is of course if the other party is also willing to talk about it.
                  Ben will try to listen to the other person and will try to understand their situation. He might give his opinion on how he would act in that specific situation.
                  This might also be, because Ben first wanted to become a psychologist.<br><br>

                </h1>
                <p>
                  <h5>Self-Critical</h5>
                  Ben always has the feeling that he can do more and better. It's very hard to satisfy himself.
                  This can also be a positive side, because sometimes this creates a feeling of guilt to work harder.<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Awkward</h5>
                  Ben is very awkward when starting out somewhere. He will need some time to get comfortable. 
                  But when he's eventually comfortable, he's a very supportive teammate.<br><br>
          
                  <h5>Direct</h5>
                  When Ben is comfortable, he can get very direct with his opinion. This is not meant to offend the other party, it's usually constructive criticism.
                  But people might see it as a personal attack.<br><br>
