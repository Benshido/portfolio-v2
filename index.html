                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>This group project was made by four students including me during an open learning semester (my
                      3rd semester) at
                      Fontys University of Applied Sciences. It is a game made for the Practoraat Interactieve
                      Technologie ROC
                      Tilburg. The goal of the game is to teach Dutch to immigrant students at Schakelcollege. These
                      students had different topics each period and we chose for the home environment topic which
                      perfectly aligned with their schedule.</p>
                    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Library research</li>
                      <li>Prototyping & Realization</li>
                      <li>Level design (3rd prototype)</li>
                      <li>Quest system (final build)</li>
                      <li>In-game audio</li>
                      <li>User Testing</li>
                      <li>Blender (3rd prototype)</li>
                    </ul>
                    Below you can find the first three prototypes that I made. You can see each prototype has huge
                    improvements and it was all merged into one prototype which was Prototype 4 (Final build).

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Followed a GameDev.TV course that taught me how to make a game in Unreal Engine 5 using
                      mainly C++ and also a few blueprints. After the course, I also created my own iteration based on
                      the game
                      that was made during the course. This was part of my 140 hours project during the open learning
                      semester (my 3rd semester) at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I wanted to get familiar with
                      Unreal Engine and C++ because I want to try and get an internship (and maybe even a job) in the
                      game industry. You had one day every week to work on this project and the final iteration is
                      rather small due to the limited amount of time. It only included: A different map, shout function
                      and background music.</p>

                    <p>A 2D platformer made by OBM Studio consisting of five students including me. The player takes
                      control of a little ghost that
                      wants to save his friend by collecting soul shards. This project was part of a big assignment
                      called "Proftaak" during my time at ROC Ter AA where I studied Application & Media Design. For
                      this assignment we decided to create a 2D platformer game. The game originally also
                      included a home made controller. We had around 6 weeks to finish it.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>During the specialization AR/VR, the class had to create a VR experience in Unity that
                      could be played using Google Cardboard. I built a game that is about coming home for work. You can
                      interact with objects and people in and around the house. To finish the game, simply go to bed or enter
                      the car. The game was built in around 3 days.</p>

      <p class="text-white">
        Hi, my name is Ben. I was born on the 12th of November 1999 in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
        <br>
        I am very passionate about games, music, movies, Japanese language & culture and being able to achieve your
        dreams.
        And I think that everybody can achieve their dreams as long as they put the time and effort into it!
        <br>
        <br>
        So, let's dive a bit deeper into my passions. The most important passions right now are games and Japanese.
        Let's start with gaming. Ever since I was a child, I played a lot of games.
        At a very young age I got a limited edition Pokémon Yellow GameBoy Color gifted, and I fell in love immediately.
        And currently I'm studying at Fontys with the main focus of creating games.
        <br>
        <br>
        Japan has also had a huge influence on me. My family has always been a huge fan of Japan and they kind of pulled
        me into it. I grew up watching Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Pokémon. Although I did watch Ultraman and Kamen Rider
        in Thai because my mom is from Thailand.
        <br>
        Back in 2013 and 2016 I went to Japan on a vacation. And that completely changed everything. Not only did I love
        Japanese media, but the country and culture as well.
        And I have made it one of my main goals to move to Japan in the future!
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2017 I started studying Oriental Languages and Communication (Japanese) at Zuyd University of Applied
        Sciences. Sadly, I did quit after 3-4 months due to subjects that did not pique my interest.
        But my love for the Japanese language and culture never went away! I kept studying Japanese every now and then.
        And noticed that textbooks aren't my thing.
        So, I'm taking a completely different approach to learning the language and I have been doing it more
        consistently!
        <br>
        <br>
        In the last 10 years, I have also had multiple side jobs in different sectors. I have worked as a stock clerk,
        newspaper deliverer, food deliverer and animal caretaker (voluntary work).
        Next to side jobs, I have also been very busy with individual projects such as making music, I play guitar,
        bass, drums, like to sing (although not that good) and produce music.
        I also used to be my brother's cameraman for his guitar covers. And lastly I have some experience with video
        editing.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2018 I started studying Application & Media Development at ROC Ter AA in Helmond, The Netherlands.
        Here I learned many coding languages mainly around Web, Software and Hardware (Arduino) development.
        While studying I had 2 interships one as a ICT (Industrial Control Techniques) Software Developer at DAF TRUCKS
        N.V. and Software Developer at Smartgoals / Spinnov.
        My graduation assignment was graded with an Outstanding (10/10) and every subject was graded above an 8 (except
        Dutch).
        <br>
        <br>
        For the upcoming next years, I plan to continue working on my game development & design, to be able to get a job
        in the very competitive game development market.
        I'm currently in my 4th semester and chose the Game Design & Technology specialization.
        I want to improve my skills with C#, C++, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.
        <br>
        <br>
        To see more of my programming skills, take a look at my resume, projects and LinkedIn!

              <h5>Reliable</h5>
              Ben is a reliable person because he feels the responsibility of his work. He will try his best not to let
              people down!<br><br>

              <h5>Passionate and Ambitious</h5>
              Ben is a very passionate and ambitious person. He will not give up on the things he wants. Ben has many
              ambitions and will work extra hard to achieve these.<br><br>

              <h5>Curious</h5>
              Ben is very curious and is always willing to learn new skills.<br><br>

              <h5>Inspiring</h5>
              Ben knows the importance of ambitions and will always tell family, friends and teammates to follow and
              work hard to achieve their own goals in life.<br><br>

              <h5>Empathetic</h5>
              If someone Ben knows struggles with something, he is always open to talk about their problems. This is of
              course if the other party is also willing to talk about it.
              Ben will try to listen to the other person and will try to understand their situation. He might give his
              opinion on how he would act in that specific situation.
              This might also be, because Ben first wanted to become a psychologist.<br><br>

              </h1>
              <p>
              <h5>Self-Critical</h5>
              Ben always has the feeling that he can do more and better. It's very hard to satisfy himself.
              This can also be a positive side, because sometimes this creates a feeling of guilt to work
              harder.<br><br>

              <h5>Awkward</h5>
              Ben is very awkward when starting out somewhere. He will need some time to get comfortable.
              But when he's eventually comfortable, he's a very supportive teammate.<br><br>

              <h5>Direct</h5>
              When Ben is comfortable, he can get very direct with his opinion. This is not meant to offend the other
              party, it's usually constructive criticism.
              But people might see it as a personal attack.<br><br>
